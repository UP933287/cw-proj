The ERD describes the database structure and relations between its tables (models). It's built using both Crow's Foot Notation and Sequelize methods' names to make it easier to understand it in the context of code.

Note: M-N relations are not broken down since the ORM automatically creates in-between tables. Similarly, foreign keys are not specified as they will be added to the models by Sequelize.
